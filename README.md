# CheatSheets

DevOps Cheatsheets

In our DevOps career we always need to work with tools and automate the day to day actions to make software delivery efficient. 

We need to look up for commands for various tools, it's syntax, usages etc., 

With this in mind, I have started a project called "DevOps Cheat Sheets" 

In this project, I am going to create cheat sheets for all the tools and also create code snippets for them.

This project has started today and it will be an ongoing project with regular updates. 

My goal is to update daily with relevant content until this repository matures to have all the content I am planning to put.
